iBusiness hired me and a few other consultants to manage their technology stack when all of their regular IT staff had left the company. It was a very interesting assignment because we had to learn how everything worked by ourselves since there was nobody else to introduce us to the software ecosystem.

In the beginning me and the other consultants began by discovering all of the available source code and figuring out which branch(es) held the latest changes used in production. Then, using the source code and the production environments, we studied the systems and figured out their interdependencies. Once we were confident enough to make deployments to production we began fixing critical bugs and building new features to keep iBusiness' end users satisfied.

Our work led to the company staying afloat and being able to hire new developers and techs, thus reducing their dependency on consultants. To me this was a very educational and fun experience because of the special circumstances in the beginning.
