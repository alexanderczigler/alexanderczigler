Urban Girls Movement ran a [project](https://globalutmaning.se/pin/urbangirlsmovement/) that aimed to improve living conditions for girls and young women in rapidly growing, socio-economically vulnerable urban areas through feminist urban planning.

A part of this project was letting girls redesign their neighbourhood inside Minecraft. I helped export the minecraft build to a model that was viewable on the web and 3D-printable for their exhibition.
