heading: Helping Getinge with aftermarket pricing and BI
years: 2008,2010

At Getinge I built a number of small Business Intelligence applications. These provided decision makers in their organisation with key data about their production and shipping. I also built a web based system for managing Getinge's aftermarket prices, called PriceManager.

PriceManager was a .NET web app written in C# and the other BI applications were made using Dataset Vision. This assigned was one of the first things I did with C# and I learned a lot about web development in .NET. This project also taught me a lot about mainframes like Movex/Lawson M3 and building data warehouses in SQL Server.
