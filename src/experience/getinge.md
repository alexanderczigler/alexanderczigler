At Getinge I worked on a number of Business Intelligence applications that aggregated and presented key data to decision makers in their organisation. I also built a web based system for managing the prices they set on all of their spare parts. PriceManager was a great help to Getinge because all of the products they manufacture are made up from parts ranging from readily available on the market to uniquely produced by Getinge themselves. Setting competitive prices on all of their spare parts and aftermarket products is an important part of maximising Getinge's revenue streams.

PriceManager was a .NET webapp and the other BI applications were made using Dataset Vision.
