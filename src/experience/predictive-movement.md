heading: Researching transport efficiency in rural Sweden

Predictive Movement is a research project that aims to improve transports and living conditions in the rural areas of Sweden. One of the main hypotheses of Predictive Movement is that citizens in rural parts of Sweden do not have access to the same level of service and quality of life that citizens in urban areas have. While working on the project we validated this hypothesis and we studied ways to both simulate the current ways that transport run and ways to improve them. These improvements whow that transports can be made more efficient, saving both money and lowering their environmental impact while at the same time improving living conditions for citizens and business living and operating in rural and remote parts of Sweden.

During the time I was working with Predictive Movement we developed a platform for route optimization as well as a digital twin that simulates the way road and air transports work in Sweden. I worked on UI sketches for the systems, I performed user testing and hosted workshops for testing and educating/enrolling third parties in the platforms. We also conducted a couple of real-world study visits and user testing where I travelled to both Ljusdal and Pajala together with a couple of coworkers. My main contribution in this project was to plan and coordinate these trips as well as summarize what we learned from them.

Towards the end I also worked on the code behind both the platform and the digital twin and I helped troubleshoot and modify the kubernetes hosting environment. The solutions were built using nodejs, elixir, typescript and rxjs. Other technologies used: using Open Street Map, Mapbox, Figma, Telegram.
