heading: UX Research at TRR
years: 2019,2020

This was my second assignment at TRR and this time I returned to do UX research instead of write code. Over the course of about a year I helped TRR understand their role on the Swedish job market and how they can maximize their impact.

We started by forming a new team and I participated in a number of workshops that my senior UX coworker facilitated. We began by doing an effect mapping and using what we learned from that we did a design sprint. The outputs of these workshops were turned into design sketches that we built in Figma and I performed a number of user tests to validate our ideas. As we began building the new digital product I later performed a number of interviews with HR managers at both small and large Swedish companies to test our product and learn more about how it can be of use to companies looking to hire.

At TRR I worked closely with my then coworker [Rebecca Nor√©n](https://rebeccanoren.com/) who taught me a lot of valuable things about interviewing people, working with prototypes, workshops and of course customer focus.
