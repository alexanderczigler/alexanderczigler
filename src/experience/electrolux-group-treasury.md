I built a custom web based ticketing system for Electrolux Group Treasury that they used for IT Change Management. This was an important step for them when becoming SOX compliant. The technical solution was built using .NET and MVC with a SQL Server for storing data. This was the very first project where I used MVC and it was fun learning it and building a webapp without web forms.
