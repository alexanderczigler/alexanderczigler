heading: Helping Electrolux meet SOX compliance
year: 2009
---

I built a custom web based ticketing system for Electrolux Group Treasury that they used for IT Change Management. Having a solid, well-defined process for tracking changes was an important step for Electrolux towards becoming SOX compliant. The technical solution was built using .NET and MVC with a SQL Server for storing data.

This was the very first project where I used MVC instead of web forms and I learned a lot about .NET and developing more modern web apps.
