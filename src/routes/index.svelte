  <p class="my-4">
    My story began around 1997 when I got my first PC with dialup internet. I quickly became
    enchanted by the web and it did not take long until I wanted to build my own homepage so that I
    could become a part of the web myself. Dialup was expensive I was only allowed to go online for
    a few hours every week. I spent that precious time online learning about HTML (and playing
    Flight Simulator 98!) and finding free hosts where I could publish my creations.

  <p class="my-4">
    In 2003 my journey took a giant leap as I got DSL at home. This was a huge thing for me as I was
    suddenly able to go online as much as I wanted; I was no longer restricted by the cost or speed
    of dialup. Having 24/7 access to the internet meant I could spend more time on the social
    aspects of the internet. I eventually found a bunch of like-minded people on IRC and I started
    making friends online. Some of the people I got to know taught me about things like linux and
    running my own servers. They inspired me to build my own computer for the first time, a computer
    that became my first home server where I installed linux for the first time in my life and I
    learned how to setup my own web server among other things.
