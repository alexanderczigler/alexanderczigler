# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Alexander Czigler. I help companies improve their culture and ways of working with code.

My story began around 1997 when I got my first PC with dialup internet. I quickly became
enchanted by the web and it did not take long until I wanted to build my own homepage so that I
could become a part of the web myself. Dialup was expensive I was only allowed to go online for
a few hours every week. I spent that precious time online learning about HTML (and playing
Flight Simulator 98!) and finding free hosts where I could publish my creations.

In 2003 my journey took a giant leap as I got DSL at home. This was a huge thing for me as I was
suddenly able to go online as much as I wanted; I was no longer restricted by the cost or speed
of dialup. Having 24/7 access to the internet meant I could spend more time on the social
aspects of the internet. I eventually found a bunch of like-minded people on IRC and I started
making friends online. Some of the people I got to know taught me about things like linux and
running my own servers. They inspired me to build my own computer for the first time, a computer
that became my first home server where I installed linux for the first time in my life and I
learned how to setup my own web server among other things.
