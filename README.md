# Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you can find some of my side-projects and tools that I use in my daily work.

## Why do you work in tech?

I have always been fond of vehicles and technology ever since I was a toddler. When I got my first PC and dialup internet around 1997 I quickly became curious of how I could make my own homepage and publish content online. What began around that time is a journey of experimentation and learning that I am still on today.

My work in tech is still very rewarding to me to this day. Most organisations and governments are in dire need of not only better software but becoming better at creating excellent software. I love working with tech in combination with the cultural changes that transform organisations into agile organisations that focus on continuous experimentation, learning and psychological safety.

## Background

My tech journey began in the late 90's when started learning HTML. In the years that followed I started learning php and asp as well as some basic graphical design for creating dynamic content and prettier designs. Around 2002 I built my first server and started experimenting with linux. As I got more into linux and freebsd systems I learned a lot about networking and setting up servers for web, irc, ftp etc.

What began as a hobby slowly transitioned into freelance work. It began with friends and acquaintances paying me to build/design websites, troubleshoot things or setup/configure computers and servers.

After high-school I went to college to study mechanical engineering but I eventually dropped out and in 2008 I began working as a consultant in Stockholm, Sweden. Since then I have been working on a vast number of different projects.

## Specialty

I am just as passionate about writing code as I am about the process of software development itself. During my career I have had the privilege of working with several different organisations and learning a lot about why IT projects fail or succeed.

With my experience of tech and software development I can work from within a dev team and help deliver code and at the same time helping the organisation discover and pin-point issues that are holding them back from becoming increasingly agile.
