# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught software developer currently working as a backend engineer at [Iteam Solutions](https://iteam.se/) in Stockholm.

My passion for software and the web began in the late 90's when I started learning basic HTML and making homepages. When I got DSL in the early 00's I built my first server and started learning about linux and setting up networks, web servers and firewalls. Since then I have been learning more and more all the time by continuous exploration and by surrounding myself with talented people who inspire me to learn and grow.
